      Version Control is a method of tracking the changes made to a document, or set of documents, affording the user the ability to revert to earlier "versions" of the document later in time. The largest benefit from using version control comes from being able to view previous states of the document. This affords the user the ability to revert back to old code in the event of a mistake or error, maintain multiple versions of the same project, as well as compare the differences between two code sets. Version control is also beneficial because it allows multiple users to engage in the document without interferring with each other. Version control can track what changes are made, when they are made and the collaborator who made the changes so that there is a record of when things happen and who is responsible. Finally, using version control when working on a project is best practice because it eliminates the risk of damaging the existing, working code when creating new code or modifying the existing program.
